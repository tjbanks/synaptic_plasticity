# Synaptic Plasticity Demo

Sample python notebook demonstrating synaptic plasticity.

Future repository will feature a python notebook to demonstrate the model, however python scripts do work as is.

The bulk of the work is done by [exp2syn1_stsp.mod](/bmtk_model/biophys_components/mechanisms/modfiles/exp2syn1_stsp.mod)

The network simply creates a virtual cell and connects it to a single target cell via Exp2Syn1_STSP synapse. Parameters are found in the associated [stsp.json](/bmtk_model/biophys_components/synaptic_models/stsp.json) file. Edit this file to adjust the effects of Facilitation and Depression (strength/tau)

### To run the network:

Edit the firing rate in [gen_input.py](/bmtk_model/gen_input.py)
```
python gen_input.py
python build_network.py
python run_bionet.py
python plot_test.py
```

The following plots were generated by this network to show synaptic depression. Current that passes through the synapse changes in response to different input frequencies. Higher input rates have a stronger effect on output.
